Note:
	1] Need to add the filter for minute granularity. ObserveredValue hasMeasuredTimeStamp. See what all this time stamp contains.
				
				
//////////// Query 4 ///////////////
Query 4: For a 많iven building code, time period and time granularity (15min/1day), return forecast KWh time series (OpenPlanet)
Not relevant yet.

//////////// Query 6 ///////////////
Query 6: For campus code, time period and time granularity (15min/1day), return weather time series (min/max temp, humid, etc)

Assumed relationship: 
Campus    ----->   Place
        campusISA

Existing relationships:		
p2:Place ----->   Location
	   hasALocation
Weather	  ----->    Location
		isObservedAt		  
Weather  -----> atmo:MeterologicalPhenomenon
		weatheriSA

Location  -----> GMLSurfaceProperty U Address U GMLPointProperty
		locationISA		

//Input:
String campusCode = "UPC";
String startDate = "11:Jan:2011";
String endDate 	 = "17:Sep:2012";
String query6 = "PREFIX Campus: <http://www.smartgrid.usc.edu/Ontology/2012.owl#> "+
				"PREFIX Place: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place> "+
				"PREFIX Weather: <http://www.smartgrid.usc.edu/Ontology/2012.owl#> " +

				"			?weather Weather:hasMeasuredDate ?measDate . " +
				"			FILTER ( ?measDate >= \""+ startDate +"\" && ?measDate <= \""+ endDate +"\") " +
				"		  }";

Note:
	1] No properties are present in Weather entity currently
	2] Need to add properties minTemp, maxtemp, humidity, etc. to it.
	3] Another approach would be to use Weather -> isA -> 'observableThing' feature approach. And then a sensor would measure 
		a 'observableFeature' in this 'observableThing'. So we will have a list of observable features that are reported by a 
		sensor that is capable of reading all the values for weather.
	4] Need to decide between 2 or 3

	
//////////// Query 7 ///////////////
Query 7: For a 많iven building code, return total occupancy capacity

Inputs:
String buildingCode = "EEB";
String query7 = "PREFIX Building: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> "+
                "SELECT ?capacity " +

				"		?building Building:hasOccupancyCapacity ?capacity . "
				//"		?building Building:hasBuildingNo ?BuildingNum . " +
				"      }";

Note:
	1] Building Entity doesn't have hasOccupancyCapacity property ... need to add it
				
				
//////////// Query 8 ///////////////
Query 8:  For a 많iven building code and time period, return list of scheduled calendar events (classroom and USC calendar)

Existing:
Activity 	   -----> p1:Schedule
				hasSchedule
Location       -----> GMLSurfaceProperty U Address U GMLPointProperty

	            subClassof
p2:Place      ----->   Location
	            hasALocation
				
New ones required:
p1:Schedule   ------>  Location
			isAtLocation				

Schedule does not have date, start time, end time, duration, etc. properties as literal values
Activity does not have name, type, etc properties. need to add that to these properties for query8
