## Overview
A smart grid tracks energy usage in real-time and works with the consumer to efficiently meet electrical power demands while minimizing energy usage. However, a major obstacle in further optimizing smart grids involves the communication between the infrastructure and its users. This project implements a mobile application to transform smart grid sensor data into useful knowledge formats that encourage sustainability. Utilizing the Cloud, this mobile app provides scalable operations in an information-rich environment, allowing distributed stream processing for low latency response -- allowing smart grids to intelligently monitor and control all electricity flowing in the power grid system.

This mobile Android application encourages sustainability and energy conservation in a campus-wide advanced metering infrastructure. The University of Southern California campus contained a smart grid infrastructure. It utilized informatics and cloud-hosted services (AWS, Eucalyptus) in the backend for scalability, sharing, and security.

This projected was developed in the spring of 2012 while taking USC's Parallel and Distributed Computing (EE-657) course taught by professor Kai Hwang. Technical guidance was provided by professor

## Hardware
This Android app was tested on a rooted HTC Amaze cell phone.
